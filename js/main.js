/**
 * Main Application JS
 * This file now delegates to the ComponentsModule for component loading
 * and only contains application-specific initialization if needed
 */

// All component loading and initialization is now handled by ComponentsModule
// in components.js which is loaded automatically when the DOM is ready.

// If you need any global application logic, add it here.
